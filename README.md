## Overview

### Requirements

Users should be able to:

-  Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
-  Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
-  View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Vanilla Javscript

### What I learned

I used this as an opportunity to work on loading content via javascript. I built a data object and loaded all the dom elements using javascript and looping through the data object (as if it was pulled in via an API).

### Continued development

I'd like to figure out how to load a template while the javascript is loading to prevent getting an empty notifications page flicker (before the javascript loads)
